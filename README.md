# $${\color{#40E0D0}FIFSOT}$$
$${\color{#40E0D0}FIFSOT}$$ is a <b>scenario-based file system automation</b> that allows users to perform daily multi-step tasks related to their files with one-click routines.

## Primary Feature: Creating and Executing Scenarios:
Combine any number and combination of operations such as Archive, Copy, Rename, and Delete, and run the scenario you created with a single click whenever you need.

There is no limit to the scenarios you can create and save.

## Other Important Features
### Rename
Renaming files inside a folder in a specific logical order has never been easier. Just provide the prefix, suffix, and sorting condition. FIFSOT will do the rest.

#### Example:
The before and after images below show a folder containing whiteboard images sorted alphabetically using the prefix WB.

| Before | After |
| :--: | :--: |

### WhoIs?
`The action can't be completed because the folder or a file in it is open in another program.`

Does the above error message sound familiar? Drag and drop the file to the WhoIs page. FIFSOT will help you find the process that is using the file.

> [!Warning]
> Terminating a running process can be end up with system crash or data loss. Therefore, do not terminate any running process unless you know or are sure what it is or what it does, even if it is a feature.
>
> This feature requires administrator privileges.

### Symlink
If you need to create symbolic links on your system somehow, you don't need to bother with commands. Just give the source and destination, and FIFSOT will create them.

> [!Note]
> Creating symlinks requires administrator privileges. You should run the program as administrator to use this feature.
